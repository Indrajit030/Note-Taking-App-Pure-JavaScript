# Note-Taking-App-Pure-JavaScript

This is a note taking app where you can take you notes through your browser. 

It is totally made using JavaScript and for styling part I used BootStrap for more responsiveness and clean interface.

Feel free to use it and **bookmark in your browser**, it will help you in instantly note down your random throughs or useful for note down any algorithm of any coding questions.

It basically uses the concept of **Local Storage** for storing the data on your browser storage. 

The notes will keeps in a safe place, until you delete it or refresing your whole browser means reinstalling or deleting data or cache.
